#: Predicting Student Performance using Machine Learning
# Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning to Uncover Hidden Patterns

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major concern for businesses, especially in subscription-based models. This project focuses on using machine learning to predict customer churn by analyzing historical customer data to uncover hidden behavioral patterns. The goal is to enable proactive retention strategies and improve customer lifetime value.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict customer churn using machine learning.
- Analyze historical data to identify risk indicators and patterns.
- Enable organizations to take timely retention actions.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Gather customer data: demographics, transactions, support logs.
2. **Preprocessing** – Clean data, handle missing values, encode variables, scale features.
3. **EDA** – Visualize patterns and correlations.
4. **Feature Selection** – Identify relevant predictors.
5. **Modeling** – Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
6. **Evaluation** – Use metrics like Accuracy, F1, ROC AUC.
7. **Interpretation** – Apply SHAP to explain predictions.
8. **Deployment (Optional)** – API or dashboard integration.
9. **Monitoring** – Track performance and retrain with new data.
